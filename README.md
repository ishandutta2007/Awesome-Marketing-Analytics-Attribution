## 🔍 Overview & SEO Context 📊

Modern marketing measurement has entered a transformative era. Driven by third-party cookie deprecation, privacy frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, Apple ATT), and omnichannel fragmentation across ad networks, digital growth teams rely heavily on scientific measurement:

- **Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)**: Deterministic, algorithmic (Markov Chain removal effects), and cooperative game theory (Shapley Values) allocating conversion credit across touchpoints.
- **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)**: Top-down Bayesian statistical causal inference evaluating media saturation (Hill functions), adstock decay, and incremental lift without user-level tracking.
- **Event Streaming & Customer Data Platforms (CDP)**: Warehouse-native first-party data collectors streaming behavioral clickstreams directly into Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, and Databricks.

## 📊 Sector Overview & Market Dynamics 🌐

The global marketing analytics and attribution software market is valued at approximately **$5.8 billion to $6.15 billion** (projected to reach over **$14 billion to $29 billion** by the mid-2030s at a **13%–17% CAGR**). 

The sector is **moderately to highly fragmented**: while enterprise cloud giants dominate broad digital analytics ecosystems, no single vendor captures a winner-take-all monopoly in cross-channel attribution, resulting in specialized fragmentation across B2B multi-touch revenue attribution (MTA), DTC e-commerce measurement, and Bayesian marketing mix modeling (MMM).
